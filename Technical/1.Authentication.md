# Authentication

## Introduction

Here is the documentation for the authentication.

## Features

This is the features we need:

* *username* login
* *password*
* *email* (for reset / notifications)
* forgot password



## Technical servers

We need an authentication server by HTTPS.

It will be use by a backend with REST API.

The data must be stored in a database, perhaps basic like MariaDB / PostgreSQL, but perhaps use openLDAP because very good for that.


## Schema


```mermaid

        participant StarDeception
        participant AuthServer
        participant OpenLDAP
        StarDeception->>AuthServer: Login from main menu (HTTPS)
        AuthServer->>OpenLDAP: Transmit login (LDAP)
        OpenLDAP->>AuthServer: transmit response (ok / ko) (LDAP)
        AuthServer->>StarDeception: Response  (HTTPS)
```
