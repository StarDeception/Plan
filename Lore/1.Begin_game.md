# Begin game

## What's happening

You were living on a planet in the Agora system, and the star exploded. You left just in time for another system.

## The new beginning

You set your first spawn by choosing a planet and city.

You're standing in line at an immigration office, waiting your turn.
Finally, it's your turn. You're given some coins and the keys to a small apartment.

You leave the office and head toward your neighborhood until you arrive at your apartment.
